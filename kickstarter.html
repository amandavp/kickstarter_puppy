    <p> We are only a few of the millions of Americans who are sick of our dogs having their butts kicked
      in the dog park. We have decided to raise our voices for the cats who have been bullied by their
      fellow brother dogs. We could really use your help in order to help you. Please donate as much as
      you can, in order to save these amazing animals from certain wedgies/noogies/death.
    </p>
